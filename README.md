Portfolio site source code!

This website is unbelievably over-engineered. Why? Because it's a great way to play with new technologies and to show how it's done!

In order to build this site locally, you need a few things:

- node.js (the site doesn't run on node, but the toolset uses it)
- npm
- grunt
- bower

Once you have cloned the repository on your local machine, and you have these installed, it's easy to run!

> npm install
> bower install
> grunt build
> grunt server

The last command will open up your browser with the site in it. Fun!
